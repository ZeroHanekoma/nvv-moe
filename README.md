my personal website.  this is where everything pushes from to minimize headaches...

https://nvv.moe to find the actual site.

thank you for viewing!  :)

Parts of the website do not push from this github directory.  Only the main landing page, and any other subpages hosted in here wil be pushed.
All services in this github, owned by me, will be MIT licensed, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

basically i'm saying feel free to steal my code.  and anything in the imgs folder.  i either found it online, or don't care that much about it.

If you're a business owner, copyright holder, or some other legal thing and you want your stuff taken down;
abuse email is at admin at nvv.moe

otherwise, enjoy my stuff.
