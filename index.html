            <h3>I Had No Idea What Else to Put Here.</h3>
			<center><img src="img/itoddler.gif" alt="iToddlers BTFO"/></center>
            <p>
              Oh, dear Apple enthusiast, it pains me to witness your blind
              devotion to a corporation that thrives on marketing hype. Allow me
              to express my disappointment in your choice of allegiance. As we
              say in California, it appears that pouring piss out of a boot with
              instructions on the heel would be an easier task for you than
              seeing through Apple's clever tactics. You are a mere pawn,
              blindly following the path laid out by Cupertino. Your obsession
              with Apple is like a festering sore that refuses to heal, an
              affliction upon your critical thinking. I would rather endure the
              company of a lawyer than be associated with someone like you.
            </p>

            <p>
              You are a feeble-minded follower, willingly succumbing to Apple's
              aura of exclusivity. Your breath reeks of conformity, devoid of
              any independent thought. You have become degenerate, surrendering
              your autonomy and embracing a lifestyle of superficiality. Your
              very existence debases me, for it reminds me of the pervasive
              consumerism that plagues our society. I despise everything about
              your blind devotion to Apple. You are nothing more than a
              brainwashed caricature, mindlessly consuming their overpriced
              products, perpetuating the cycle of status-seeking and
              materialism.
            </p>

            <p>
              You are a pitiful creature, a parasitic leech attached to Apple's
              ecosystem. Your life revolves around brand allegiance, a hollow
              monument to the shallowness of your choices. You exude a stench of
              artificiality, repulsing those who value true innovation and
              freedom of choice. Your presence is an insult to the diversity and
              creativity that exists outside the walled garden of Apple's
              ecosystem.
            </p>

            <p>
              You are a bleating fool, a sheep in the herd of Apple devotees.
              Your mind is so clouded with Apple's marketing rhetoric that you
              have become a curdled, stumbling mutant dwarf, incapable of
              discerning reality from the illusion crafted by Apple's slick
              advertising campaigns. You are an insensate calf, blindly
              following the herd, abandoned by those who brought you into this
              world as they realized the magnitude of their mistake.
            </p>

            <p>
              Belonging to the same species as you fills me with profound
              embarrassment. Your blind devotion to Apple has turned you into a
              monstrous being, an arrogant ogre devoid of critical thinking. The
              mere thought of your mindless worship of Apple makes me want to
              retch. Your presence is as appealing as a paper cut, repelling
              even the most ardent Apple enthusiasts. You are vile, worthless, a
              mere cog in Apple's profit-driven machinery. You are a weed
              choking the garden of technological progress, a fungus spreading
              the dogma of closed systems and restricted innovation. And, of
              course, I must mention the lingering scent of overpriced Apple
              products that surrounds you.
            </p>

            <p>
              If, by some miracle, you possess a modicum of intelligence, you
              have surely squandered it on embracing Apple's closed ecosystem.
              You have failed to grasp the fundamental principles of
              technological freedom and consumer choice. Your personality is as
              bland as Apple's user interface, lacking any depth or character.
              You are a dank, lifeless soul, trapped in the confines of a gilded
              cage constructed by Apple's marketing team. Your asinine and
              benighted worldview is a testament to the power of manipulation
              and branding.
            </p>

            <p>
              You are the source of all that is unpleasant in the world of
              technology. Your unwavering support of Apple spreads misery and
              sorrow to those seeking true innovation and openness. Your
              unwarranted idolization of a company reflects your ignorance and
              cluelessness about the broader technological landscape. You are a
              prime example of the harmful effects of Apple's monopolistic
              practices and closed ecosystem.
            </p>

            <p>
              I struggle to comprehend the immense level of stupidity you
              possess, especially when it comes to your unwavering loyalty to
              Apple. Your mind is so depleted of rationality that it has
              collapsed upon itself, forming a dense singularity of sheer
              foolishness. Your intellect is trapped within this singularity,
              unable to escape the event horizon of your Apple-induced delusion.
              Your stupidity emits a gravitational pull that eclipses the
              intelligence of our entire galaxy. You are a cosmic anomaly, a
              quasar of stupidity. Your writing must surely be an intentional
              act of trolling, for no sentient being could genuinely exhibit
              such mind-numbing ignorance. Your existence challenges the very
              fabric of our universe, defying the laws of reason and common
              sense. I apologize, but I cannot continue this discourse. Your
              immense stupidity has drained me of the strength to engage with
              your misguided beliefs and uninformed comments. Duh.
            </p>

            <p>
              Perhaps, in the future, once you have liberated your mind from the
              clutches of Apple's closed ecosystem, you will find the capacity
              to read, write, spell, and count beyond the limited confines of
              the Apple world. These basic skills, which most of us
              &quot;normal&quot; individuals take for granted, may present a
              challenge for someone so deeply entrenched in the Apple mindset. I
              sincerely wish you the best of luck as you navigate the emotional
              and social struggles that accompany your devotion to a
              corporation. May you find liberation from the chains of Apple's
              influence.
            </p>

            <p>
              P.S.: It is important for me to point out that your blind
              admiration for Apple is not only hypocritical but also
              detrimental. Apple's greed knows no bounds as they exploit their
              loyal fan base, perpetuating a cycle of consumerism and planned
              obsolescence. Their business practices are tainted with avarice
              and their products are often overpriced and tasteless. Apple's
              closed ecosystem fosters an atmosphere of control and restriction,
              stifling innovation and limiting consumer choice. It is
              disheartening to witness how easily you fall victim to their
              deceptive marketing tactics. Your idolization of Apple reflects a
              fundamental lack of understanding and critical thinking. Your
              unwavering support for a company that exhibits such unethical
              behavior and engages in anti-competitive practices is truly
              disturbing.
